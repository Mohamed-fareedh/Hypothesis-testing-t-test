## Introduction :
A t-test is a statistical test that is used to compare the means of two groups. It is often used in hypothesis testing to determine whether a process or treatment actually has an effect on the population of interest, or whether two groups are different from one another.

## When to do the t-test :
A t-test can only be used when comparing the means of two groups (a.k.a. pairwise comparison). If you want to compare more than two groups, or if you want to do multiple pairwise comparisons, use an ANOVA test or a posthoc test.

The t-test is a parametric test of difference, meaning that it makes the same assumptions about your data as other parametric tests. The t-test assumes your data:
are independent
are (approximately) normally distributed
have a similar amount of variance within each group being compared (a.k.a. homogeneity of variance)
If your data do not fit these assumptions, you can try a nonparametric alternative to the t-test, such as the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test for data with unequal variances.
